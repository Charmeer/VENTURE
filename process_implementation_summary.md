# Process Section Implementation Summary

## Files Created/Modified:

1. **Process.jsx** - Standalone React component for process overview
2. **process_overview.md** - Markdown version for documentation/reference
3. **frontend/src/pages/Process.jsx** - Updated existing Process page with comprehensive content

## Key Features Implemented:

### Process Overview Section
**Five-Step Conversion Process:**
1. **Feedstock Collection and Sorting** - Collection from local sources with basic sorting
2. **Size Reduction and Drying** - Shredding to uniform size and moisture optimization
3. **Pyrolysis Reactor Processing** - Controlled thermal decomposition at 400-500°C with catalysts
4. **Product Separation** - Fractional condensation separating liquid fuel, gases, and solid residue
5. **Quality Testing and Storage** - Final quality control and proper storage

### Development Roadmap
**Four-Phase Implementation Approach:**
- **Phase 1**: Initial Setup and Pilot Implementation
- **Phase 2**: Operational Stabilization  
- **Phase 3**: Optimization and Efficiency Improvement
- **Phase 4**: Replication and Scaling

### Technical Specifications Included
- Operating temperature: 400-500°C
- Conversion efficiency: 70-80%
- Catalyst type: Zeolite-based
- Output distribution: Liquid fuel (60-70%), Gaseous fuel (20-25%), Solid residue (5-10%)

## Data Sources:
All information is derived from your existing project JSON files:
- backend/data/process.json
- backend/data/technology.json

## Implementation Notes:
- Content formatted for non-technical audience
- Clear sequential flow presentation
- Logical phase-based development approach
- All statements traceable to existing project data
- No external engineering steps or assumptions added
