# Process Overview

## Plastic Waste Conversion Process

Our systematic approach transforms plastic waste into valuable energy resources through a carefully controlled five-step process designed for efficiency and quality.

### Step-by-Step Process Flow

**Step 1: Feedstock Collection and Sorting**
Collection of mixed plastic waste from local sources with basic sorting to remove non-plastic materials. This ensures only appropriate feedstock enters the processing system.

**Step 2: Size Reduction and Drying**
Plastic waste is shredded to uniform size and dried to optimal moisture content. This preparation step ensures consistent processing conditions and maximizes conversion efficiency.

**Step 3: Pyrolysis Reactor Processing**
Controlled thermal decomposition occurs in the presence of catalysts at temperatures between 400-500°C. This advanced process breaks down plastic polymers into valuable hydrocarbon products.

**Step 4: Product Separation**
Fractional condensation separates the output into three distinct streams: liquid fuel (60-70%), gaseous fuel (20-25%), and solid residue (5-10%). Each product is captured and processed separately.

**Step 5: Quality Testing and Storage**
Final product testing ensures all quality parameters are met before proper storage. This quality control step guarantees consistent fuel standards for end users.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase-Based Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Initial Setup and Pilot Implementation**
Establishment of the first micro-scale processing unit with focus on system commissioning and initial operational procedures. This phase emphasizes learning and process optimization at small scale.

**Phase 2: Operational Stabilization**
Refinement of operational procedures and establishment of consistent production standards. Focus on achieving reliable daily operations and quality control protocols.

**Phase 3: Optimization and Efficiency Improvement**
Systematic enhancement of processing efficiency and output quality. Implementation of continuous improvement measures based on operational experience and performance data.

**Phase 4: Replication and Scaling**
Expansion through deployment of additional micro-scale units following the proven model. Each new unit builds upon lessons learned from previous implementations while maintaining standardized processes.
