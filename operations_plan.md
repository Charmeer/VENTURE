# Operations Plan – Implementation Details

## Operational Framework Overview

Our systematic operational approach ensures efficient day-to-day management of the plastic waste conversion system with clearly defined workflows for feedstock handling, processing operations, and output management.

## Daily Operations Workflow

### Feedstock Intake and Handling
- **Collection**: Mixed plastic waste sourced from local collection points
- **Sorting**: Basic separation to remove non-plastic materials
- **Preparation**: Size reduction through shredding to uniform dimensions
- **Drying**: Moisture content optimization for processing efficiency

### Processing Operations
- **Capacity**: 150 tons of feedstock processed monthly
- **Utilization Rate**: 85% plant operational efficiency
- **Operating Conditions**: Controlled thermal decomposition at 400-500°C
- **Catalyst System**: Zeolite-based catalyst implementation

### Output Handling and Utilization
- **Fuel Production**: 105 tons of fuel products monthly
- **Product Distribution**: Liquid fuel (60-70%), gaseous fuel (20-25%), solid residue (5-10%)
- **Quality Control**: Final testing and certification before storage
- **Storage Management**: Proper containment and handling protocols

## Implementation Process

### Initial Setup Requirements
