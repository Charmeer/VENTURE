# Impact Assessment – Sustainability Metrics

## Impact Assessment Overview

The plastic waste conversion system delivers measurable environmental benefits, financial returns, and positive social outcomes for local communities through a triple-bottom-line approach. The system addresses India's significant plastic waste challenge by converting 1,800 tons of plastic waste annually into valuable fuel products while creating local employment opportunities and reducing environmental pollution.

## Sustainability Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

**Waste Diversion:**
- 1,800 tons of plastic waste diverted from landfills annually
- 150 tons of plastic waste processed monthly
- 85% plant utilization rate

**Conversion Efficiency:**
- 70-80% conversion rate with high-quality fuel output
- 105 tons of fuel production capacity monthly
- 60-70% liquid fuel yield from feedstock

**Economic Value Generation:**
- ₹25 lakhs monthly revenue
- ₹700 lakhs revenue over 5-year period
- ₹4.9 lakhs monthly net profit
- 218% return on investment over 5 years

**Emissions Reduction:**
- 12,000 tons of CO2 reduction annually
- Elimination of open burning and improper disposal practices

## Environmental Impact

### Waste Reduction
The system significantly diverts plastic waste from traditional disposal methods, preventing 1,800 tons of plastic from entering landfills each year. This addresses the critical issue where 70% of India's 3.5 million tons of annual plastic waste currently ends up in landfills, oceans, or is burned.

### Cleaner Energy Production
The pyrolysis process converts plastic waste into valuable liquid fuel (60-70% yield) and gaseous fuel (20-25% yield), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels. This fuel substitution reduces dependency on traditional energy sources while utilizing waste materials.

### Environmental Burden Reduction
The system eliminates pollution from open burning and improper plastic disposal methods. The controlled thermal decomposition process at 400-500°C with zeolite-based catalysts ensures environmentally responsible waste processing compared to traditional disposal methods.

## Economic Impact

### Revenue Generation
The facility generates substantial economic value through multiple revenue streams:
- Liquid fuel sales: ₹18 lakhs/month
- Gaseous fuel sales: ₹3.5 lakhs/month
- Waste processing fees: ₹2 lakhs/month
- By-product sales: ₹1.5 lakhs/month

### Local Economic Benefits
The operation creates significant local economic impact through:
- 15-20 direct employment opportunities
- Enhanced local tax base contributions
- Support for decentralized micro-scale operations
- Development of local business opportunities

### Cost Structure
Monthly operational costs total ₹10.05 lakhs, including:
- Raw materials: ₹4.5 lakhs
- Labor costs: ₹2.8 lakhs
- Utilities and maintenance: ₹2.0 lakhs
- Transportation and miscellaneous: ₹0.9 lakhs

## Social Impact

### Community Health Improvement
The system contributes to improved air and water quality by eliminating open burning practices and preventing plastic waste contamination of local water sources. This addresses significant health hazards associated with traditional plastic waste disposal methods.

### Skill Development and Employment
The facility provides direct employment for 15-20 local workers while offering technical training programs that develop specialized skills in waste processing and renewable energy technologies.

### Waste Management Infrastructure
The operation enhances local waste collection systems and creates entrepreneurship opportunities for community members to participate in the waste-to-energy value chain.

### Community Development
The project supports local business development and strengthens the community's technical capabilities in sustainable waste management practices.

## Operational Impact Summary

**Monthly Processing Capacity:** 150 tons of plastic waste
**Fuel Production:** 105 tons of high-quality liquid and gaseous fuels
**Waste Diversion:** 1,800 tons annually from landfill disposal
**Emissions Avoidance:** 12,000 tons of CO2 equivalent reduction yearly
**Local Employment:** 15-20 direct jobs with skill development programs
**Financial Returns:** 218% ROI over 5-year investment period

The system demonstrates measurable sustainability outcomes across environmental, economic, and social dimensions while maintaining strong financial viability through diversified revenue streams and efficient operational processes.
